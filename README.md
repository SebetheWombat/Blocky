# Blocky
A simple platform game that you can play here: http://sebethewombat.github.io/Blocky/ <br><br>

## Description
Use the arrow keys to collect the happy yellow blocks but avoid contact with angry red blocks. This is my first project to include a gradient background, more advance collision detection, and very basic explosion effects on contact.
