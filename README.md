# Blocky
Basic platform game
Play it here: http://sebethewombat.github.io/Blocky/ 
This is a simple platform game where the player controls a white block and tries to collect the happy yellow blocks.
Touching the angry red blocks will shrink the player until they disappear and must restart.
This is my first project to include a gradient background, more advance collision detection, and very basic exploding effects on contact.
